Creates class ‘Stack’ which implements a stack using a linked list.

The following methods are implemented:
Push(x): Push an integer “x” into the stack.
Pop(): Pop the last element inserted in the stack and return it. If the stack is empty return -1.
Top(): Return the last element inserted in the stack, but do not pop it. If the stack is empty return -1.
isEmpty(): Return 1, if the stack is empty. Else, return 0.

INPUT FORMAT:
First line contains Q, the number of operations to be performed on the stack.
Each of the next Q lines represents a single operation of the format:
push x → Push(x)
pop → Pop()
top → Top()
empty → isEmpty()
