This is a naive attempt to replicate a generic vector container from C++ STL.
Implements the basic operations of a vector.

INPUT FORMAT:
First line contains any one of the following operation to initialize the vector:
1.vector c → Vector(c)
2.vector c x → Vector(c, x)
3.vector → Vector()

Next line contains Q, the number of operations to be performed on the stack.

Each of the next Q lines represents a single operation of the following format:
push x → push(x)
pop → pop()
front → front()
back → back()
capacity → capacity()
size → size()
sort → sort()
element i → operator[] 

OUTPUT FORMAT:
front,back,capacity,size,element : Prints the returned element
sort : Prints the sorted elements
